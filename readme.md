<h4> Web Application for the administration of Appointments with Doctors and Patients made With Laravel. <h4>
    
<h3> How to Install </h3>

Laravel requires you to have an app encryption key which is generally randomly generated and stored in your .env file. The app will use this encryption key to encode various elements of your application from cookies to password hashes and more.

Laravel’s command line tools thankfully make it super easy to generate this. In the terminal we can run this command to generate that key. (Make sure that you have already installed Laravel via composer and created an .env file before doing this, of which we have done both).

<pre><code> php artisan key:generate </pre></code>

If you check the .env file again, you will see that it now has a long random string of characters in the APP_KEY field. We now have a valid app encryption key.

# 7. Create an empty database for our application

Create an empty database for your project using the database tools you prefer (My favorite is SequelPro for mac). In our example we created a database called “test”. Just create an empty database here, the exact steps will depend on your system setup.

# 8. In the .env file, add database information to allow Laravel to connect to the database

We will want to allow Laravel to connect to the database that you just created in the previous step. To do this, we must add the connection credentials in the .env file and Laravel will handle the connection from there.

In the .env file fill in the DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD options to match the credentials of the database you just created. This will allow us to run migrations and seed the database in the next step.

# 9. Migrate the database

Once your credentials are in the .env file, now you can migrate your database.

<pre><code> php artisan migrate </pre></code>

It’s not a bad idea to check your database to make sure everything migrated the way you expected.

# 10. [Optional]: Seed the database

If your repository has a seeding file setup, then now is the time to run the seed, which fills your database with starter or dummy data. If the repo doesn’t mention the existence of a seeder file, then skip this step.

After the migrations are complete and you have the database structure required, then you can seed the database (which means add dummy data to it).

<pre><code> php artisan db:seed </pre></code>

Many of the repos I create for tutorials here on DevMarketer will create 25 randomly generated users and 100 randomly generated blog posts in your database. If you want to log in as a user, grab an email address from the database and use “secret” as the password to log in as that user. That is the default password I generally use.

All of this information is usually contained within the GitHub readme file, so be sure to check it when starting a new project from a Github repo.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
